Understanding these transmission channels is crucial for policymakers in assessing the potential impact of their monetary policy decisions and for investors and businesses in anticipating changes in economic conditions. However, it's essential to note that the effectiveness of these channels can vary depending on factors such as the state of the economy, financial market conditions, and the credibility and clarity of central bank communication.
